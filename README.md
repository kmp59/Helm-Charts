## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kmp59/Helm-Charts/edit/charts/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kmp59/Helm-Charts/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    Helm repo add helmrepo1 https://<orgname>.github.io/helm-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages. You can then run `helm search repo helmrepo1` to see the charts.

To install the demo-chart:
    
    helm install my-demo-chart helmrepo1/demo-chart

To uninstall the chart:
    
    helm delete my-demo-chart
